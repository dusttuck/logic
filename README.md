# logic.tex: User-friendly plain TeX macros for formal logic

logic.tex is a collection of mutually-independent plain TeX macros for intuitive typesetting of standard formal logic with code that is easy to produce and easy to parse, even for people withno TeX or programming experience

To see the macros in action and play around with them, you can view the documentation on Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/read/nzyfjtnrvrgh.

Here's a brief list of what the macros cover:
- Single-character abbreviations for symbols, such as `>` and `-` for → and ¬
- Fitch-style proofs
- Truth tables
- Arguments (premises and a conclusion separated by a horizontal line)
- Diagrams of relative height (as countermodels to prove invalidity)
- Italic math letters with word-like kerning
- Sans-serif math letters

I wrote these primarily so that students could complete problem sets, quizzes, and exams on Overleaf. Here are a few examples:
